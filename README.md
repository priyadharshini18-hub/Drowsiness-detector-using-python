# Drowsiness-detector-using-python
Here is my mini project on "Drowsiness detector using python - OpenCV, dlib, facial landmarks". 

Facial landmarks are used to localize and represent salient regions of the face, such as:
->Eyes
->Eyebrows
->Nose
->Mouth
->Jawline

This project gets live input feed from the web camera and detects the coordinates of the eyes, eyebrows, mouth and calculates the aspect ratio to check if the person is drowsy or not.

This project has two modules:
1. Drowsiness detection from yawning
2. Drowsiness detection from the coordinates of the eyes

Whenever drowsiness is detected, an alert message will be displayed on the screen.
